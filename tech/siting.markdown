## Temperature

The sensor measuring temperature should be open to wind and try to measure atmospheric temperature.

- should be open to wind (good wind circulation)
- screen from sun and rain
- Mount away from possible sources of radiation, like walls, hedges and trees (at least 25 cm away from concrete/radiation sources)
- should be housed in an open area clear from obstructions
- vertical gradients matter. Ideally sensor should be 1.25M above ground level. (rooftops may not have accurate reading)
- screen should be above loose soil/grass but not packed soil or concrete.


The stevenson Screen should be over grass or loose soil but never on top of packed soil or concrete. The 
screen should be away from anything absorbing solar radiation.(at least 25cm away from concrete and other 
radiation sources)


## Rain

Rain gauge should catch over a large area.

1. Keep away from obstructions 
2. Do not mess the airflow
3. Rain gauge should not be in a Rain shadow area
4. Distance from obstructions should be greater than 2 times height of such objects
5. Minimize ground effect turbulent flows(?)

3. Rain gauge should be on level - measure with spirit Gauge

## Pressure

Pressure may be affected by gusts of wind. The Stevenson screen mouting should be tested for wind gusts
 
## Humidity

1. Lot of errors (5% is common)
2. Best is to calibrate against some standard equipment. A better check can be made around the middle of 
a breezy day by comparing readings with a neighbouring calibrated station
3. Sensor should measure extreme conditions (very dry days, very humid days)
