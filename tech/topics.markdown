# Active research topics

imp: please add the new topics at the of this file.

## SIM 300 vs. SIM 900

- what kind of voltage is required to drive the modem?
- what kind of current is drawn when in active use? (we need this to match with battery's C-rating)
- cost and availability
- Which model is better to drive on batteries?

## RTC chips

- We need some RTC chip with alarm capability. What models (from reputed comanies only) are there that can send a level interrupt to Arduino at fixed time intervals? 
- What is the procedure to enable the alarms?
- Can DS1307 deliver an alarm?
- What is the difference between alarms and square-wave output?
- Cost and availability


## circuit protection

- How to clamp voltages? (zener didoe?)
- Opto couplers etc. for back voltage/surge protection
- Hardware debounce IC
- zero PCB practice
- Heat sinks
- Voltage regulators - linear vs. switching 
- ESD protection (do we have to use GDT?)
- Fuses
- cost/availability

## SD card breakout

- Big size breakout
- cost/availability options

## Battery 

- Suitable battery as backup power source for Arduino Uno + SIM300 modem
- How to switch automatically between Battery and wall power supply

- what is the recommendation?
	1. C-rating
	2. Voltage
	3. Packs
	4. Capacity
	5. 80% rule
	6. impedance/internal resistance

## BBB Bare bone board
