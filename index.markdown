aws is a community driven project for citizen weather monitoring. We aim to provide blueprints, code 
and guideline to create your own aws(automatic weather station) . To this end we are releasing all our work 
under a very liberal apache license. You can use all our blueprints and code for personal use as well as 
any derivative work as you see fit.

We plan to learn and engage with you in the process. Whether you are a student, hobbyist or 
a professional, all are welcome.

## Plan
Our plan is to release

- Standard hardware list

- Arduino and MSP430 based electronics
- Code for collecting and communicating data 
- Help documents
